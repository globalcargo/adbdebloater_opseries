# OOS/H2OS Debloater
This is a Debloater for Oxygen OS. Though it doesn't come with many bloats there are still bloats that could be removed to increase performance and battery life.

This is a fork from the magicalmammal's excellent work that started with the OP7 series. I am using this fork to curate my personal setup for the OP Nord (EU rom). I have tried to document the various apps and commented out (using a leading "#" suitable for bash for Linux) those I am not removing. My setup may not be right for you or even break your device, for which I take no responsibility. So please keep that in mind when using this work. 

You can find the original releases without my customization [here](https://github.com/DevilDipan/adbdebloater_opseries/releases)

###### Though the performance improvement is not visible the same to me battery life increased by 30+%.
